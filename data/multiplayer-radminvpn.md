make sure both of you have siege enabled in  firewall(https://pureinfotech.com/allow-apps-firewall-windows-10/) (enable private and public)\
Restart game
If that doesn't work go to radmin and via tab systeem > firewall > allow rainbowsix.exe
Ensure that both of you have the same siege version (Even if its the same season, you's may have a different exe!)
