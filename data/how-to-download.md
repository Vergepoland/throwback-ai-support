# How to download

## Prep

First we are going to prepare your setup.

1. Make a folder where you wish to download (make sure it's not inside of a OneDrive folder).
2. Go to your antivirus settings and make exception or exclusion on the newly made folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
[#how-to-make-an-excpetion-exclusion](faq/antivirus.md#how-to-make-an-excpetion-exclusion "mention")
{% endhint %}

3. Go to webrowser and enable in settings in section downloads and turn on the "ask where to download" (depends on what browser but overal the same)

now that you are done wiht the little prep, you won't need to mess with turning off your antivirus ever again. Also don't forget to download the dotnet 6 in Operation Throwback in channel r6downloader.

## Downloading with Steam

Now that you installed dotnet it's time you download the r6downloader

1. download the r6downloader in [r6download channel](https://discord.com/channels/1092820800203141130/1092833532981809293).
2. choose your folder (the one with exclusion just saying)
3. click on r6downloader todo it's thing
4. insert legacy name (aka your first name aka your login name, check picture)

Make sure to download the correct downloader because steam updates it's api and so does the depotdownloader.

5. choose your game you like to download and while you at it read the faqs too because yes
6. press enter to continue if still waiting check taskmanager if it's using resources if not\
   restart it and try again.
7. now go to your game, normaly you should see codex.ini if not copy the correct crack from the resource/plaza/ folder. Check the faqs for the correct version of the crack.\\
8. Open the codex.ini file and change your gamename to an unique name. (will crash if you have multiple versions).\
   while you at it change username to random thing doesn't need to be unique.
