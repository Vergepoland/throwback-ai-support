Welcome to the frequently asked questions page!  
Here you can find answers to many questions we on the staff get asked frequently.  

# General
## I do not own Rainbow Six: Siege on Steam, can I download using my Ubisoft/Epic Games account instead?
The simple answer is that you **cannot**.  
The technical answer is that our downloaders use Steam's depot service in order to download old versions of the game from their servers.  
In order to get access to the Steam servers, you need a valid Steam account that has a valid license for Rainbow Six: Siege registered to it.  
You cannot authorize a connection to the **Steam** depot servers using a **Ubisoft** or **Epic Games** account, just like you cannot log into Steam using your Ubisoft or Epic Games account.

# Security
## Why does the downloader ask for my Steam account details? Is this safe?
The downloader needs your account details in order to authorize its connection to the Steam servers, where the game is downloaded from.  

## Why does my antivirus flag many of these files as malicious? Is this safe?
Many of our files are falsely flagged as malicious and they are safe to use.  

## Is it safe for Radmin VPN to show my IP address to others?
The IP address listed inside of a Radmin VPN network is not your *real* IP address.  

# Game Errors
### Note: Make sure you have a properly configured antivirus exclusion before trying any of the solutions below.

## When I launch my game it says *steam_api64.dll* is blocked?
The most likely cause of this error is launching the wrong file when starting your game.  
An example: launching *RainbowSix.**exe*** instead of *RainbowSix.**bat***  
  
Make sure that when you launch the batch (*.bat*) file, you leave it running untouched for up to a minute. It will eventually open your game.  

### The solution did not fix or apply to my problem?
If you do not have a batch (*.bat*) file or you keep getting this error, try replacing your crack files.

## "Your install appears to have missing files. Please verify the integrity of your install through Steam."
If you get this error while trying to start your game, you will need to replace your crack files.

## My game keeps crashing on launch, how do I fix it?
