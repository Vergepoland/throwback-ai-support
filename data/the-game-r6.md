## My old Siege version is stuck preparing content, how do I fix it?

Close the game and restart it, if that doesn't work [verify your files](r6downloader-r6manifest.md#how-do-i-verify-my-game-files-and-what-is-the-meaning-of-verify)

## Why is my .exe/ launch application missing?

It didn't complete with the download, [verify your files](r6downloader-r6manifest.md#how-do-i-verify-my-game-files-and-what-is-the-meaning-of-verify) or if you are one of the other country's [#what-is-sku-rus-and-what-country-has-it](r6downloader-r6manifest.md#what-is-sku-rus-and-what-country-has-it "mention"), then search the method in the help channel\
keyword is russian and tag is solution.

## Why is my game crashing at the start screen (after pressing button)?

You didn't change your gamename, change it in the Codex.ini files, if you like to change your username it can be any name, check in the ini files (the ones that kind of resembles the name of crack to change it, codex.ini is were you change username too)

## How to change gamename and username

check codex.ini for both (plazacrack) or check codex.ini for gamename and cplay.ini (lungu crack aka crack.zip)

## My game displays Russian language how to switch to English

In case you used the SKU RUS option and want to have other game languages than Russian use the localization.lang file that is located in [#guides-and-faqs](https://discord.com/channels/1092820800203141130/1092835326692691978)

## How to fix video glitches from GPU

Vulkan and Directx are graphics generation apis, both of them essentially explain to the gpu what to render. in the latest build of live they offer users which version they would prefer as there are pros and cons to both, it is compatible with AMD graphics card aswell

> **here are things to keep in mind when considering Vulkan (everyone is gonna be different because everyone has different hardware):**

* slightly lower average fps but resulting into better 1% lows (1% lows are the lag spikes which aren't ping, like game freezes)
* better for older hardware in comparison to dx11
* you can still have the latest Nvidia drivers without the game having weird texture bugs where you can't see anything (the gray shit)

> **here are things to keep in mind when considering dx11**

* usually higher average fps but resulting in worse 1% lows (game might stutter more, not a definite)
* not that big of a difference for mid-range/high spec'd pcs performance is very similar
* you have to use an Nvidia driver version between **530-546** to have the game playable until its fixed in later driver updates

> **These are the fixes for this season**

* Use this Link [from Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx) to **Download the Specific Driver** in the image provided
