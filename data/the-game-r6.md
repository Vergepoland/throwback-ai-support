## How to fix video glitches from GPU

Vulkan and DirectX are graphics generation apis, both of them essentially explain to the gpu what to render.

> **here are things to keep in mind when considering Vulkan (everyone is gonna be different because everyone has different hardware):**

* slightly lower average fps but resulting into better 1% lows (1% lows are the lag spikes which are game freezes)
* better for older hardware in comparison to dx11
* you can still have the latest Nvidia drivers without the game having weird texture bugs where you can't see anything (the gray shit)

> **here are things to keep in mind when considering dx11**

* usually higher average fps but resulting in worse 1% lows (game might stutter more, not a definite)
* not that big of a difference for mid-range/high spec'd pcs performance is very similar
* Update your drivers to the latest version to fix the graphical issues.
