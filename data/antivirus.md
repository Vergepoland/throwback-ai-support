## How to make an exception/exclusion?

Click the Windows key and search for "Virus & Threat Protection". Click on "Manage settings" under "Virus and threat protection settings". Then scroll all the way down to "Exclusions" and click on “Add or remove exclusion”. Click on "Add an exclusion" and then "Folder".

For other antivirus softwares, Google is your friend (McAffee does not offer the option to exclude an entire folder)

### Is this a virus

No.

### My antivirus software says it's a threat?

It's generally a false positive for one of these reasons:

* the program you downloaded is not signed with a certificate
* the program you downloaded edits the game memory

### I made an exception but it still doesn't work?

This could be caused by a previous antivirus scan, make sure you add a folder exception for everythingthat has to do with old siege (including downloader/tools) and replace everthing (don't delete just replace aka redownload (tools/downloader)
