# How to report your problem the best way

## Template report

make sure when making a post, you choose the correct tags

#### 1. Title

In here we want a good title that gives us the general idea of said problem\
The title is placed in the discord Thread or Community post.

#### 2. Description

A good description about said error, what you did to become said error and what things you tried to solve it. (number 2 and 3 can be switched too)

#### 3. Photo/picture/screenshot

A good screenshot helps a good amount. we know just by looking where you need togo in the faqs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't use your phone to make photo/screenshot on the pc
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the windowskey + shift + s to make a screenshot
{% endhint %}

#### 4. Ping helper in your post
